# Wine API

RESTful API for managing wines

Version 1.0.0

## Endpoints

Feel free to use the [corresponding POSTMAN collection](wine-api.postman_collection).

### GET /wines/?year=<type>&type=<type>&name=<name>&country=<country>
Returns a list of wine object which are stored in the database. Use the optional query parameters ``year``, ``type``, ``name`` and ``country`` to filter your results.

### GET /wines/:id
Retrieves a wine by id.

### POST /wines/
Creates a new wine database entry. Payload for POST is for instance:

	{
		id: 3,
		name: 'Cabernet sauvignon',
		year: 2013,
		country: 'France',
		type: 'red',
		description: 'The Sean Connery of red wines'
	}

Note that the following attributes ``year``, ``type``, ``name`` and ``country`` are mandatory, while ``description``is optional. ``type``needs to be one of ``red``, ``white``, ``rose``.

### PUT /wines/:id
Update the wine with the given id. Payload is the same as POST.

### DELETE /wines/:id
Delete a wine by id.

The API is now available at http://localhost:8080/wines

## Tests

## Improvements in future versions

Things to do better time permitting: 

* Use promises instead of callbacks
* Move some of the logic from controllers into Wine model
* Use of standard HTTP status codes:

   * 404 for UNKNOWN_OBJECT
   * 400 for empty query parameters
   * 201 for CREATED
   * 304 for NOT MODIFIED
   * 405 for METHOD NOT ALLOWED
   * 418 for good measure

* Add CORS (using ``server.use(restify.CORS());``) if integration in 3rd party web apps planned 
* HATEOS responses
* Result pagination
